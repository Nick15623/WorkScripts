## Requirements ##
Python 3.0 or higher

## Description ##
This is a python script that prompts the user for serial numbers and inventory numbers. It will then append the numbers
collected to a created .csv file that you will be asked to name. The .csv file can then be added to excel inventories,
uploading, or whatever you may need the .csv file for. 

## Note ##
This does work with scanners as well. We specifically use Inateck blutooth scanners, however, I am sure most scanners
should be able to be used.
